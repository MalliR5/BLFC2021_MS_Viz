 Capture files made by Bandaid Roo (@BandaidRoo)
The finalized MagicQ showfile from Biggest Little Fur Con 2021, Main stage. Offsets and inverts have been tweaked to work with the visualization. 

Contains MQBA (MagicQ Busking Architecture) A2, and MQShake A1. 

If you don't have a wing, use the Playback window to access the numerous playbacks from wings 1 and 2. 

As for the capture files, you don't need Capture Symphony Edition to run and play with it with MagicQ connected. 
The capture files will work with any version of Capture, even the demo, you just won't be able to save changes to it. 

This showfile does not have any Demo Mode dependencies, you can explore and interact with all aspects of it without need for hardware.

If you don't own Capture, you can download the demo from at https://www.capture.se/

To import the MagicQ showfile, place it within the the "show" directory in your MagicQ folder or put it on a flash drive, whichever you prefer.
Requires minimum stable version 1.9.1.6, Beta 1.9.2.2 recommended.
